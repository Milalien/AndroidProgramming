# My first android app
An app I developed as a part of my "Android and Java programming" course.

## Home page

Contains GAME, HELLO and EXAM buttons and a searchfield.

### HELLO

By pressing the button, the "Hello!" text changes to invisible.

### GAME

A small game where you try to find the hidden dark star under the cards. Saves the latest score.

### EXAM

Exam assignment, a simple currency convertor.
Input amount in the preferred currency, choose the right one, and it calculates the value in euros.

### Search

Input a searchword, it searches for it in YTJ company database (https://avoindata.prh.fi/ytj.html) 
and gives you a list of companies that have your searchinput in their name.
By clicking on the name, it opens other info about the company.

## Dashboard

On this tab you can find a page that searches your current location and you can open it in Google Maps. 
For this you need to manually give the app permission to use your location fro,m your settings.

## Notifications

On this tab there is a timer that can be set to 1-60 seconds. It will count down and once finished it shows an animation and rings a notification sound.
